		<p>Most programming blogs feature posts from veteran programmers teaching others new concepts and techniques. However, I am a beginning programmer and I plan to blog about the things I’m learning and the difficulties I’m having. Hopefully I can help other beginning programmers, but more importantly I hope people will get involved and teach me to code!</p>

<h2 id="why-i-chose-to-use-hexo">Why I Chose To Use Hexo</h2>

<p>Over the years, I’ve experimented with many different ways to manage a blog. My very first website, handcoded in HTML in the late ’90s had a “news” section which was basically a primitive blog. After a lot of dabbling, I decided to use the <a href="http://hexo.io">Hexo</a> static website framework to manage this blog. The primary factors in my decision to use Hexo were:</p>

<h3 id="it-uses-markdown">It uses markdown.</h3>

<p>This could be a whole other future post about why rich-text and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editors are evil. Ever since I discovered the <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost">Ghost</a> CMS, I’ve been excited about blogging in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy">markdown</a>. I do almost all of my writing in markdown anyway, so I wanted a system that uses it. With Hexo, blog posts are essentially markdown notes with frontmatter.</p>

<h3 id="it-generates-static-websites">It generates static websites.</h3>

<p>This means it can be managed locally offline and then published to a remote server using Git. Using tools that are available offline is important to me, as there are still many situations where I might want to work without internet access.</p>

<p>Another advantage of generating static pages is that the site can be hosted for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. This means I don’t have a manage a server and I can focus instead on what’s most important, <em>the content</em>.</p>

<h3 id="its-open-source-and-only-depends-on-nodejs--git">It’s open-source and only depends on Node.js &amp; Git.</h3>

<p>In order to use Jekyll, I had to install and configure Ruby, which isn’t a part of normal workflow. The only dependencies Hexo requires are Node.js &amp; Git (I’m actually using a lot of other open-source projects for this blog, but they’re all managed with npm). I already use Node.js, so getting Hexo up &amp; running was as simple as executing:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>npm install -g hexo-cli
<span class="gp">$ </span>hexo init project-name
<span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>project-name
<span class="gp">$ </span>npm install
<span class="gp">$ </span>hexo serve
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>On a more philosophical note, as much as possible I try to use open-source software, and since I am currently focusing on JavaScript, I really wanted to use a tool that was written in JavaScript so that I could understand how it works and possibly even extend it down the line.</p>

<h3 id="teach-me-to-code">Teach Me To Code</h3>

<p>What do you think about my criteria? Is there a better choice I could have made? And any other questions or comments, hit me up on social media.</p>
